# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a computer science engineer with two years of experience in software development, I have gained expertise in various aspects of product design and development. My primary programming languages include Python and Java, with experience in design, testing, debugging, and automation. I have worked in both industrial and academic settings, developing RESTful APIs with Flask and PostgreSQL, including building a Java-based website using ReactJS, and creating an Android app with React Native and JavaScript.

One of my passions is machine learning, where I have obtained Google Cloud Platform certifications on machine learning, designed a handwritten number recognition tool using TensorFlow, implemented deep learning layers via Keras, and conducted exploratory data analysis and preprocessing for data prediction. In addition, I have also developed a real-time Twitter spam detector, utilizing Tweepy API.

Another area of interest for me is data analysis and visualization, where I have used SQL to query and manipulate data from various sources, such as relational databases, CSV files, and web APIs. I have also used Tableau to create interactive dashboards and reports that showcase the insights and findings from the data. I have applied these skills routinely in work and projects.

Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science in Information Systems at Northeastern University and as part of my course curriculum, I'm exploring AWS cloud computing and technologies such as GIT for version control, Github Actions for CI/CD, Terraform for creating infrastructure as code, Packer for building machine images, and various testing tools like unittest, Pylint, JMeter, and Postman

As a student, I am continually expanding my knowledge and skills, and I am excited to take on new challenges and make a meaningful impact in the industry.
