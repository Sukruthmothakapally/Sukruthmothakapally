# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a computer science engineer with two years of experience in software development and testing using Python and Java. I have worked on RESTful APIs, websites, Android apps, and SQL databases.

I am passionate about machine learning and data analysis. I have obtained Google Cloud Platform and IBM certifications on machine learning, big data, and data analysis utilizing Python, SQL, Excel, and Tableau.

I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Information Systems at Northeastern University where I am exploring courses in big data systems, intelligent analytics, data science methods, and AWS cloud computing. I have gained hands-on skills in technologies such as Airflow for data pipeline automation, TensorFlow for ML models, Flask and FastAPI for backend development, GIT for version control, Github Actions for CI/CD, Terraform for creating infrastructure as code, and Packer for building machine images.

As a student, I am continually expanding my knowledge and skills, and I am excited to take on new challenges and make a meaningful impact in the tech industry.
