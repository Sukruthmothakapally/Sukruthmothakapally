# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer with over two years of hands-on experience in software development, backend services, and cloud architecture. Currently, I am interning at PipeIQ.ai, where I am part of the founding team. I develop next-gen AI-powered tools using OpenAI, Langchain, and various AWS services to drive key features like automated and hyper-personalized email generation. My work includes building FASTAPI microservices architectures, developing core functionalities like authentication and role-based access control, integrating LLM agents into sales workflows, and implementing frontend components using React and JavaScript to create seamless user interfaces.

I am also pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Software Engineering at Northeastern University, where I focus on advanced topics such as big data systems, intelligent analytics, parallel computing, and AWS cloud infrastructure. I have gained expertise in technologies like Airflow for data pipeline automation, TensorFlow for machine learning models, Flask and FastAPI for backend development, and Terraform for infrastructure as code.

With a strong foundation in Python, Java, and cloud platforms like AWS and GCP, I have developed scalable RESTful APIs, microservices, and cloud-native applications. My academic and professional experience includes developing machine learning applications, such as an AI-based Stack Overflow app and an audio emotion classifier, and automating infrastructure for improved deployment efficiency.

Driven by a passion for innovation and problem-solving, I look forward to applying my skills and knowledge to tackle complex challenges in the tech industry.
