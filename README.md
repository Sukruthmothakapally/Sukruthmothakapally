# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a computer science engineer with two years of experience in software development, I have gained expertise in various aspects of product design and development. My primary programming languages include Python and Java, with experience in design, testing, debugging, and automation. I have worked in both industrial and academic settings, developing RESTful APIs with Flask and PostgreSQL, including building a Java-based website using ReactJS, and creating an Android app with React Native and JavaScript.

One of my passions is machine learning, where I have obtained Google Cloud Platform certifications on machine learning, designed a handwritten number recognition tool using TensorFlow, implemented deep learning layers via Keras, and conducted exploratory data analysis and preprocessing for data prediction. In addition, I have also developed a real-time Twitter spam detector, utilizing Tweepy API.

Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science in Information Systems and as part of my course curriculum, I'm exploring technologies such as GIT for version control, unittest for testing, Jenkins for CI/CD, Terraform for infrastructure as code, Packer for machine images, and deploying backend to AWS. As a student, I am continually expanding my knowledge and skills, and I am excited to take on new challenges and make a meaningful impact in the industry.
