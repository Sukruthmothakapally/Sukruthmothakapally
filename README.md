# LET ME INTRODUCE MYSELF ðŸ‘‹


- I'm an experienced software engineer with a Master's in Computer Software Engineering from Northeastern University.

- I've worked at 2 AI startups as part of the founding team, taking AI-driven SAAS products from 0â†’1 and helping drive revenue.

- I thrive in multi-hat responsibilities, working directly with leadership, including the CEO - to turn ideas into solid MVPs.

- My core strength is backend development with microservices, using Python and Java frameworks.

- In the AI space, I've built multi-agent systems, designed RAG-based architectures, fine-tuned LLMs, worked on prompt engineering, and used frameworks like LangChain, LangGraph, and Autogen.

- I've built scalable AWS & GCP native full-stack apps, set up CI/CD pipelines, and handled data engineering workflows.

- For the frontend, I sometimes work with React, JavaScript, and TypeScript. Not my main focus, but I can get things up and running when needed.
