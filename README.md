# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Sukruth Mothakapally, a software engineer focused on building scalable systems, AI-powered tools, and cloud-native applications. Recently, I was part of the founding engineering team at PipeIQ.ai, where I developed key microservices and integrated AI-driven features to enhance user engagement. Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Computer Software Engineering at Northeastern University, where I also work as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for the Data Structures and Algorithms course.

With expertise in Python, Java, and cloud platforms like AWS, Iâ€™m passionate about crafting efficient, impactful solutions to tackle complex tech challenges.
